# Why You Need a Credit Card

Credit cards can be a valuable financial tool if used responsibly. Here are some reasons why you should consider getting a credit card:

## 1. Reward Programs

Many credit cards offer attractive rewards programs that allow you to earn cash back, points, or miles on your everyday spending:

- **Discover it Cash Back**: Earn cash back on rotating categories and receive an automatic cash back match at the end of your first year.
- **Chase Freedom Flex**: Earn 5% cash back on rotating categories, 3% on dining and drugstores, and 1% on other purchases.
- **Chase Sapphire**: Earn valuable Ultimate Rewards points on travel and dining, with additional benefits like travel insurance and airport lounge access.
- **Chase Freedom Unlimited**: Earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases.
- **Bilt Credit Card**: This unique card allows you to earn points on rent payments, providing a routing number and account number without being charged by the merchant.
- **Deserve EDU Student Card**: A great option for international students, this card doesn't require an SSN and offers cash back on all purchases.
- **AMEX Gold**: Earn Membership Rewards points on dining, groceries, and travel, along with additional benefits like dining credits and travel insurance.

## 2. Build Your Credit Score

A good credit score can help you qualify for lower interest rates on loans and better terms on credit products. Using a credit card responsibly, such as by paying your balance in full and on time each month, can help you build a strong credit history and improve your credit score.

## 3. Travel and Loyalty Programs

Many credit cards, especially those offering reward points or miles, are part of travel and loyalty programs like American Express Membership Rewards (MR) and Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR). These programs allow you to transfer points to partner airlines and hotels, often providing significant value:

- **Airlines**: United Airlines, Delta, and American Airlines are just a few examples of the many airline partners available for point transfers.
- **Hotels**: Transfer your points to hotel partners like Hyatt to book award stays at luxurious properties around the world.

By strategically using credit cards with rewards programs and building your credit score, you can unlock a world of financial benefits and opportunities.
